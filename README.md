# hass-aarlo

## 2FA Support

This release contains beta 2FA support. It works by requesting an email with
the one-time code and then making an IMAP connection to your email provider
and reading the code from the email Arlo sends.

There is a **lot** that can go wrong with this - for starters, I've only
tested it in English and German - but to get it working add the following
configuration (with the correct values obviously) - to `aarlo:`

```yaml
  tfa_host: imap.gmail.com
  tfa_username: your.email.account@gmail.com
  tfa_password: roygbiv

```
Please note, that even though Arlo only shows 2FA via SMS in the interface,
aarlo will trigger sending an e-mail as alternate method.

For gmail users, the following
[help](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) is useful.

Arlo made 2FA mandatory by End of November 2020, so you need to use this for
the integration to work.


## Notice of Future Breaking Changes

### The custom services are moving into the `aarlo` domain.

This release moves all the component services in the `aarlo` domain. This is
their correct location and allows Home Assistant to use the component's
`services.yaml` file to provide help with the services.

To allow you to transition and test your scripts the old, incorrectly located,
services will remain for a while. My plan is to remove them in a few months. If
you move all your code over to the new services you can add the
`hide_deprecated_services` option to your configuration to hide these old
services.

See [Services](#advanced-services) for more information.

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction
Aarlo is an Asynchronous Arlo component for [Home
Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), it uses the [Arlo
Website](https://my.arlo.com/#/cameras) APIs and supports base stations,
cameras, lights and doorbells.

Aarlo is based on the original [Arlo
component](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/arlo/) and it can operate
as replacement with minimal configuration changes.

Aarlo also provides a custom [Lovelace
Card](https://github.com/twrecked/lovelace-hass-aarlo), which overlays a
camera's last snapshot with its current status and allows access to the cameras
recording library and live streaming.

<a name="introduction-features"></a>
#### Features

Aarlo provides:
- Access to cameras, base stations, sirens, doorbells and lights.
- Asynchronous, almost immediate, notification of motion, sound and button
  press events.
- Ability to view library recordings, take snapshots and direct stream from
  cameras.
- Tracking of environmental stats from certain base station types.
- Special switches to trip alarms and take snapshots from cameras.
- Enhanced state notifications.
- Media player support for select devices.

<a name="introduction-notes"></a>
#### Notes
This document assumes you are familiar with Home Assistant setup and configuration.

Wherever you see `/config` in this document it refers to your Home Assistant
configuration directory. For example, for my installation it's `/home/steve/ha`
which is mapped to `/config` by my docker container.

<a name="introduction-thanks"></a>
#### Thanks
Many thanks to:
* [Pyarlo](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-arlo) and
  [Arlo](https://github.com/jeffreydwalter/arlo) for doing all the hard work
  figuring the API out and the free Python lesson!
* [sseclient](https://github.com/btubbs/sseclient) for reading from the event
  stream
* [Button Card](https://github.com/kuuji/button-card/blob/master/button-card.js)
  for a working Lovelace card I could understand
* [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=hass-aarlo) for the excellent
  **PyCharm IDE** and providing me with an open source license to speed up the
  project development.

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

**You only need to use one of these installation mechanisms. I recommend HACS.** 

<a name="installation-hacs"></a>
#### HACS
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

_Aarlo is part of the default HACS store. If you're not interested in development
branches this is the easiest way to install._

<a name="installation-manually"></a>
#### Manually
Copy the `aarlo` directory into your `/config/custom_components` directory.

<a name="installation-from-script"></a>
#### From Script
Run the install script. Run it once to make sure the operations look sane and
run it a second time with the `go` parameter to do the actual work. If you
update just rerun the script, it will overwrite all installed files.

```sh
install /config
# check output looks good
install go /config
```

<a name="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

<a name="configuration-moving"></a>
### Moving From Arlo
You can replace all instances of `arlo` with `aarlo` in your Home Assistant
configuration files to start using Aarlo. The following sections detail new
configuration items you can use to add extra functionality to your new Aarlo
component.

You can also run Arlo and Aarlo side by side but you will need to create an
Aarlo specific login.

<a name="configuration-login"></a>
### Creating a Login
_If you are replacing the original Arlo component you don't need to do this step._

Aarlo needs a dedicated Aarlo login. If you try to reuse an existing login -
for example, the login from the Arlo app on your phone - the app and this
component will constantly fight to login.

When you have created the Aarlo login, from your original Arlo account grant
access to any devices you want to share and give the Aarlo user admin access.

<a name="configuration-main"></a>
### Main Configuration
The following configuration is the minimum needed.

```yaml
aarlo:
  username: !secret arlo_username
  password: !secret arlo_password
```

I recommend the following configuration, it adds some connection keep alive
mechanisms to try to work around limitations in using the Arlo web API.

```yaml
aarlo:
  username: !secret arlo_username
  password: !secret arlo_password
  refresh_devices_every: 2
  stream_timeout: 120
  reconnect_every: 90
```

* `refresh_devices_every` tells the code to reload the device list every 2 hours.
* `stream_timeout` tells the event stream to restart after 2 minutes of inactivity.
* `reconnect_every` force the system to logout and log back in, in this case every 90 minutes.

<a name="configuration-alarm"></a>
### Alarm Configuration

The following enables and configures the base stations.

```yaml
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: aarlo
    away_mode_name: armed
    home_mode_name: home
    night_mode_name: night
    trigger_time: 30
    alarm_volume: 8
```

* `away_mode_name` Arlo mode to use when setting alarm to `Armed Away`. Default value is
  `armed` which maps to Arlo's default `Armed` mode.
* `disarmed_mode_name` Arlo mode to use when setting alarm to `Disarmed`. Default value is
  `disarmed` which maps to Arlo's default `Disarmed` mode.
* `home_mode_name` Arlo mode to use when setting alarm to `Armed Home`. Default value
  `home`.
* `night_mode_name` Arlo mode to use when setting alarm to `Armed Night`. Default value
  `night`.
* `trigger_time` determines how long, in seconds, the triggered alarm will sound
* `alarm_volume` determine how loud, from 1 to 8, the triggered alarm will sound

Arlo does not have a built in `home` or `night` mode. If you need them create
a custom mode in Arlo and `home_mode_name` and `night_mode_name` to map to
them. You don't need to map all modes - I don't use `night_mode`. Names are
case insensitive. Using duplicate names will cause problems, for example,
mapping both `away` and `night` mode to `armed` will work when setting the
mode from Home Assistant but might not show the correct mode if you change it
in the Arlo app.

See [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/arlo/#alarm) for more information on
mode names.


<a name="configuration-camera"></a>
### Camera Configuration

The following enables any cameras.

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: aarlo
```

<a name="configuration-binary"></a>
### Binary Sensor Configuration

The following enables and configures the binary sensors.

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: aarlo
    monitored_conditions:
      - motion
      - sound
      - ding
      - cry
      - connectivity
```

Items on the `monitored_conditions` can be one or more of the following:

* `motion` fires when a camera, doorbell or light detects motion.
* `sound` fires when a camera detects a sound.
* `ding` fires when a doorbell is pressed.
* `cry` fires when crying is detected (ArloBaby only)
* `connectivty` is true when Arlo a device is connected

The Arlo back end sends the notifications on the event stream so they are
(almost) real time.

<a name="configuration-sensor"></a>
### Sensor Configuration

The following enables and configures the sensors.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: aarlo
    monitored_conditions:
      - total_cameras
      - last_capture
      - recent_activity
      - captured_today
      - battery_level
      - signal_strength
      - temperature
      - humidity
      - air_quality
```

Items on the `monitored_conditions` can be one or more of the following:

* `total_cameras` is a global sensor showing the number of cameras detected.

The rest of the sensors appear per camera.

* `last_capture` The last time an event was captured by this camera.
* `recent_activity` Is `on` if activity was recently seen on the camera.
* `captured_today` The number of events captured by the camera today.
* `battery_level` The percentage of battery remaining.
* `signal_strength` The Wi-Fi signal strength of the camera.
* `temperature` The temperature in the room where the camera is, if supported.
* `humidity` The humidity in the room where the camera is, if supported.
* `air_quality` The air quality in the room where the camera is, if supported.

If you have an Arlo Smart plan the 'last_capture' sensor has the attribute
'object_type' containing what Arlo cloud service believes to have identified
as a string ("Person", "Vehicle", "Animal", ...). You can use templating in HA
to trigger or condition automations based on this or record the info using an
additional template sensor.

<a name="configuration-light"></a>
### Light Configuration

The following enables any lights:

```yaml
light:
  - platform: aarlo
```
The component supports the standard Arlo lights, Arlo Baby lights and Arlo Pro
3 Floodlight. There is one noticeable quirk, you can adjust the brightness of a
light while it is on but the change will not happen until you turn the light
off and back on again. This how the official web interface works.

This does not apply to the Pro 3 Floodlight as the brightness can be changed
while it is turned on.

<a name="configuration-switch"></a>
### Switch Configuration

The following enables and configures some pseudo switches:

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: aarlo
    siren: True
    all_sirens: True
    snapshot: True
    doorbell_silence: True
    siren_volume: 1
    siren_duration: 10
```

* `siren` If `True`, will create a switch for each siren device that allows your to turn
  it on or off.
* `all_sirens` If `True`, will create a switch for all the siren devices that allows you
  to turn them all on and off.
* `snapshot` If `True`, will create a switch for each camera to allow you to take a
  snapshot.
* `doorbell_silence` If `True`, will create two switches for each doorbell, to allow
  silencing of chimes alone, or both chimes and calls.

`siren_volume` and `siren_duration` controls how loud, from 1 to 10, the siren is and how
long, in seconds, it sounds.

<a name="configuration-media"></a>
### Media Player Configuration

The following enables media player for supported devices:

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: aarlo
```

<a name="configuration-lovelace"></a>
### Custom Lovelace Card Configuration

A custom Lovelace card which is based on the `picture-glance` can be found here:
https://github.com/twrecked/lovelace-hass-aarlo

The custom Lovelace card allows access to the video recordings library and
presents customizable camera information on the camera feed. It was influenced
by the Arlo web interface camera view.

*This piece is optional, `aarlo` will work with the standard Lovelace cards.*


<a name="other"></a>
## Other

<a name="other-naming"></a>
### Naming
Entity ID naming follows this pattern
`component-type.aarlo_lower_case_name_with_underscores`.

For example, a camera called "Front Door" will have an entity id of
`camera.aarlo_front_door`.

For full compatibility `aarlo` will decode Unicode characters. This means a
camera called `Haustür` will be called `component-type.aarlo_haustur`.

If you do not want this behaviour - and be warned, this may cause problems
using certain HA services - add `no_unicode_squash: True` to your
configuration.


<a name="other-saving-media"></a>
### Saving Media
If you use the `save_media_to` parameter to specify a file naming scheme
`aarlo` will use that to save all media - videos and snapshots - locally. You
can use the following substitutions:

- `SN`; the device serial number
- `N`; the device name
- `Y`; the year of the recording, include century
- `m`; the month of the year as a number (range 01 to 12)
- `d`; the day of the month as a number (range 01 to 31)
- `H`; the hour of the day (range 00 to 23)
- `M`; the minute of the hour (range 00 to 59)
- `S`; the seconds of the minute (range 00 to 59)
- `F`; a short cut for `Y-m-d`
- `T`; a short cut for `H:M:S`
- `t`; a short cut for `H-M-S`
- `s`; the number of seconds since the epoch

You specify the substitution by prefixing it with a `$` in the format string.
You can optionally use curly brackets to remove any ambiguity. For example,
the following configuration will save all media under `/config/media`
organised by serial number then date. The code will add the correct file
extension.

```yaml
  save_media_to: "/config/media/${SN}/${Y}/${m}/${d}/${T}"
```

The first time you configure `save_media_to` the system can take several
minutes to download all the currently available media. The download is
throttled to not overload Home Assistant or Arlo. Once the initial download is
completed updates should happen a lot faster.

The code doesn't provide any management of the downloads, it will keep
downloading them until your device is full. It also doesn't provide a NAS
interface, you need to mount the NAS device and point `save_media_to` at it.

<a name="other-streaming"></a>
### Streaming

You need to use the custom `aarlo-glance card. And you need to do one or both
of these:
- add `stream` to the `image_click` options of the card
- add `stream` to the `image_top` or `image_bottom` options of the card

Streaming works with Home Assistant and, for most people, will just work.
But there are still some things to be wary of.

#### Direct Streaming

Arlo recently upgraded their streaming servers to support `mpeg-dash`. You can
stream this directly to your browser without going through your Home Assistant
install.

One of the biggest advantages of direct streaming was audio support but that
has been added to non-direct streaming in recent Home Assistant releases.
Direct streaming still offloads the conversion from your Home Assistant server
and reduces the bandwidth usage of your home network, this is especially true
if streaming from out side of your home network.

You can not stream directly to Apple devices, they don't support `mpeg-dash`.

Internally the code will use non-direct streaming as needed. For example, to
save recording into the Arlo library of longer that 30 seconds the code must
open a stream to the Arlo servers, it can only do this in non-direct mode
because the stream component doesn't support `mpeg-dash`.

To use it on your `aarlo-glance` card you need to add `direct` to the
`image_view` options of the card. You can mix direct and non-direct cards on
the UI.

#### Virtual Env

To get streaming working in `virtualenv` you still need to make sure a couple
of libraries are installed. For `ubuntu` the following works:

```
source your-env/bin/activate
sudo apt install libavformat-dev
sudo apt install libavdevice-dev
pip install av==6.1.2
```

<a name="other-snapshots"></a>
### Snapshots
Snapshots can be tricky.

The initial implementation would issue a `fullFrameSnapshot` request and Arlo
would return a snapshot. The problem was it wasn't very consistent, I have 2
identical cameras where snapshot will work on one and not the other. Arlo uses
the this implementation to allow you to position the camera and I've seen it
not work on their web interface and app.

The next implementation would start a stream and issues a snapshot command -
mimicking the camera button show on the live stream on the web interface.
Again, this mostly worked but some cameras would steadfastly refuse to send
back a snapshot.

The latest version adds to the previous stream version by allowing the updated
thumbnail from the stream to be used as the snapshot image. This method works best
but there are still some pieces of configuration you can tweak to make it
better.

* `stream_snapshot`; set to `True` to turn on stream snapshots, default `False`.
* `stream_snapshot_stop`; a positive integer, the number of seconds to stop the
  stream after starting it for a snapshot, default 10. This can help speed up cameras that
  won't send a snapshot on request. Setting it to 0 will let Arlo stop the
  stream when it thinks it has become idle.
* `snapshot_checks`; an integer array, default values 1 and 5. Force Aarlo to do
  a media library check to see if the snapshot has appeared. Useful when
  systems fail to send `mediaUploadNotifications`.
* `snapshot_timeout`; a positive integer, default 60. How long to give the
  snapshot to appear before stopping everything.


This is a summary of possible sizes:

| camera | user_agent | stream_snapshot | worked    | size      |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| street | linux      | yes             | yes       | 640x352   |
| street | linux      | no              | sometimes |           |
| front  | linux      | yes             | yes       | 1920x1072 |
| front  | linux      | no              | yes       |           |
| street | apple      | yes             | no*       |           |
| street | apple      | no              | sometimes | 1280x720  |
| front  | apple      | yes             | yes       |           |
| front  | apple      | no              | yes       | 1920x1072 |

_*And I know up until about 2 weeks ago this row was working._

_street_ is an original Arlo (VMC3030)
_front_ is an Arlo Pro (VMC4030P)

<a name="other-user-agents"></a>
### User Agents

The following user agents are available:
- `arlo`; the original `netgear` use agent, this is the default and
  will get `rtsps` streams from the Arlo servers.
- `linux`; a newer `Chrome` user agent, this will get `mpeg-dash` streams from
  the Arlo servers.
- `apple`, `ipad`, `iphone`, `mac`, `firefox`; these simulate these devices or
  browsers and, for now, these return `mpeg_dash` streams.

As you can see, the user agent you supply to Arlo determines what streaming
format is used. I used to think that the agent you used to login had to be the
same as the agent you use to start a stream. After some testing I find this is
not the case.

What this means is `aarlo` can select the best user agent for the task.

- The `camera.record` service will use `arlo` agent so Home Assistant can save
  the stream as `mp4`.
- The `camera.play_stream` service will use `arlo` agent so Home Assistant can
  convert the stream to `hls`.
- The `arlo_stream_url` web service will use the `linux` agent to return a URL
  to an `mpeg-dash` stream.

Those `camera.play_stream` and `arlo_stream_url` changes are important, they
allow the `aarlo-glance` Lovelace card to choose direct or non-direct streams
irregardless of the default user agent provided.

The default user agent is used in all other cases. This means, for example,
the one you set if picked for snapshot operations.

<a name="other-best"></a>
### Best Practises and Known Limitations
The component uses the Arlo webapi.
* There is no documentation so the API has been reverse engineered using
  browser debug tools.
* Streaming times out after 30 minutes.
* The webapi doesn't seem like it was really designed for permanent
  connections so the system will sometimes appear to lock up. Various work
  arounds are in the code and can be configured at the `arlo` component level.
  See next paragraph.

If you do find the component locks up after a while (I've seen reports of
hours, days or weeks), you can add the following to the main configuration.
Start from the top and work down:
* `refresh_devices_every`, tell Aarlo to request the device list every so
  often. This will sometimes prevent the back end from ageing you out. The
  value is in hours and a good starting point is 3.
* `stream_timeout`, tell Aarlo to close and reopen the event stream after a
  certain period of inactivity. Aarlo will send keep alive every minute so a
  good starting point is 180 seconds.
* `reconnect_every`, tell Aarlo to logout and back in every so often. This
  establishes a new session at the risk of losing an event notification. The
  value is minutes and a good starting point is 90.
* `request_timeout`, the amount of time to allow for a http request to work. A
  good starting point is 120 seconds.

Unify your alarm mode names across all your base stations. There is no way to
specify different mode names for each device.

Arlo will allow shared accounts to give cameras their own name. If you find
cameras appearing with unexpected names (or not appearing at all), log into
the Arlo web interface with your Home Assistant account and make sure the
camera names are correct.

You can change the brightness on the light but not while it's turned on. You
need to turn it off and back on again for the change to take. This is how the
web interface does it.

You might see `CloudFlareChallengeError`s. There is a strange interaction
between Python's networking and the Cloud Flare servers. I'm working on it.

<a name="other-debugging"></a>
### Debugging
If you run into problems there please provide the following in the bug report
to help debugging.
* Version of software running.
* Make of cameras and base stations you have.

I might also ask you to turn on component logging and event logging. The
follow paragraphs show you how, it's safe to leave these running if you fancy
poking around and trying to find out what it going wrong.

* Component logging. You can turn this on by adding the following to your
  `configuration.yaml` file.
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.aarlo: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.alarm_control_panel: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.binary_sensor: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.camera: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.light: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.media_player: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.sensor: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.switch: debug
    pyaarlo: debug
```

  If, for example, you suspect the problem is just with your lights you can
  remove unneeded debug:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.aarlo: debug
    custom_components.aarlo.light: debug
    pyaarlo: debug
```

	Home assistant logs everything to `/config/home-assistant.log`, a typical piece of
	debug from Aarlo looks like this.
```
2020-01-21 11:44:48 DEBUG (ArloBackgroundWorker) [pyaarlo] fast refresh
2020-01-21 11:44:48 DEBUG (ArloBackgroundWorker) [pyaarlo] day testing with 2020-01-21!
2020-01-21 11:44:50 DEBUG (ArloEventStream) [pyaarlo] async ping response subscriptions/XXXXXX-XXX-XXXXXXX_web
```
  If you fancy diving in, and please do, searching for exceptions and any
  reference to `traceBack` is a good place to start.


* Event logging. You can look at what events Arlo is sending you by turning on
  event stream dumping. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file
  and Aarlo will dump events into `/config/.aarlo/packets.dump`:
```yaml
aarlo:
    # current config here
    packet_dump: True
```

   This file will built up from a constant trickle of packets from Arlo. The
   following expert shows a login confirmation and a subscription check
   response.
```
{'status': 'connected'}
{ 'action': 'is',
    'from': 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX',
    'resource': 'subscriptions/XXXXXX-XXX-XXXXXXX_web',
    'to': 'XXXXXX-XXX-XXXXXXX_web',
    'transId': 'web!38a29262-1ce0-4c4d-8f75-fafec2c34332'}
```

  Another example, if Arlo detects motion you will see a packet with the
  following field in it:
```
'properties': {'motionDetected': True},
```

<a name="other-sensitive"></a>
### Hiding Sensitive Data

If you paste any debug logs into GitHub it's a good idea to encrypt them
before uploading them. You can do this one of two ways.

#### Online

You can encrypt your output on this
[webpage](https://pyaarlo-tfa.appspot.com/). The page doesn't forward the
output to me so you will have to copy and paste it into a bug report.

#### Pyaarlo

You can do this using the [pyaarlo](https://github.com/twrecked/pyaarlo)
component. The easiest way to install it is in a virtual environment. The
following steps will install Pyaarlo.

```bash

#### Notes
Data isn't anonymised internally... I will be adding that functionality.

You don't need to keep re-installing pyaarlo, just re-activate the virtualenv.
```bash
$ cd where-you-where-before
$ source pyaarlo/bin/activate
(pyaarlo) $ pyaarlo --help
```

When you're finished with pyaarlo deactivate the virtualenv.
```bash
(pyaarlo) $ deactivate
$
```

For recordings longer than 30 seconds you will need to white list the /tmp
directory. This is because we have to keep a stream to Arlo open to prevent
them from stopping the recording after 30 seconds. And we write this stream to
the /tmp directory.

For `restart_device` you need to login with the main account.

These services are deprecated and will be going away. By moving services under
the aarlo domain it allows Home Assistant to use the `services.yaml`
descriptions.

<a name="advanced-automations"></a>
### Automation Examples

#### Update camera snapshot 3 seconds after a recording event happens

```yaml
- id: 'automation-0100'
  alias: Camera Snapshot
  trigger:
  - entity_id: camera.aarlo_camera1,camera.aarlo_camera2
    for: 00:00:03
    from: 'idle'
    platform: state
    to: 'recording'
  - entity_id: camera.aarlo_camera1,camera.aarlo_camera2
    for: 00:00:03
    from: 'recently active'
    platform: state
    to: 'recording'
  condition: []
  action:
  - data_template:
      entity_id: "{{ trigger.entity_id }}"
    service: camera.aarlo_request_snapshot
```

#### Begin recording when an entity changes state

```yaml
- id: 'automation-0101'
  alias: Record video when garage opens
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - entity_id: cover.garage_door
    platform: state
    to: open
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      duration: 300
      entity_id: camera.aarlo_garage
    service: camera.aarlo_start_recording
```

<a name="2fa"></a>
## 2FA

Aarlo supports 2 factor authentication and contains some measures to trigger a
resend of the 2FA token number should it not work the first time. Aarlo will
also continue to try to login in the background.

<a name="2fa-automatic"></a>
#### IMAP

For IMAP 2FA Arlo needs to access and your email account form where it reads
the token Arlo sent.

```yaml
aarlo:
  tfa_source: imap
  tfa_type: email
  tfa_host: imap.host.com
  tfa_username: your-user-name
  tfa_password: your-imap-password
```

It's working well with my gmail account, see
[here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en) for help setting
up single app passwords. If needed, you can specify a port by appending it to
the host.

```yaml
aarlo:
  tfa_source: imap
  tfa_type: email
  tfa_host: imap.host.com:1234
  tfa_username: your-user-name
  tfa_password: your-imap-password
```

<a name="2fa-push"></a>
#### PUSH

PUSH 2FA Arlo is used when account is set for 2FA to phone app.

```yaml
aarlo:
  tfa_source: push
  tfa_type: PUSH
  tfa_retries: 5 # optional: default 5; attempts to check for push approved
  tfa_delay: 5 # optional: default 5; seconds of delay between retries

```

<a name="2fa-rest-api"></a>
#### Rest API

This mechanism allows you to use any suitably configured/programmed website.
When you start authenticating Arlo makes a `clear` request and repeated
`look-up` requests to a website to retrieve your TFA code. The format of these
requests and their responses are well defined but the host Arlo uses is
configurable.

```yaml
aarlo:
  tfa_source: rest-api
  tfa_type: SMS
  tfa_host: custom-host
  tfa_username: test@test.com
  tfa_password: 1234567890
```

* Pyaarlo will clear the current code with this HTTP GET request:
```http request
https://custom-host/clear?email=test@test.com&token=1234567890
```

* And the server will respond with this on success:
```json
{ "meta": { "code": 200 },
  "data": { "success": true, "email": "test@test.com" } }
```

* Aarlo will look up the current code with this HTTP GET request:
```http request
https://custom-host/get?email=test@test.com&token=1234567890
```

* And the server will respond with this on success:
```json
{ "meta": { "code": 200 },
  "data": { "success": true, "email": "test@test.com", "code": "123456", "timestamp": "123445666" } }
```

* Failures always have `code` value of anything other than 200.
```json
{ "meta": { "code": 400 },
  "data": { "success": false, "error": "permission denied" }}
```

Aarlo doesn't care how you get the codes into the system only that they are
there. Feel free to roll your own server or...

##### Using My Server

I have a website running at https://pyaarlo-tfa.appspot.com that can provide
this service. It's provided as-is, it's running as a Google app so it should
be pretty reliable and the only information I have access to is your email
address, access token for my website and whatever your last code was. (_Note:_
if you're not planning on using email forwarding the `email` value isn't
strictly enforced, a unique ID is sufficient.)

_If you don't trust me and my server - and I won't be offended - you can get
the source from [here](https://github.com/twrecked/pyaarlo-tfa-helper) and set
up your own._

To use the REST API with my website do the following:

* Register with my website. You only need to do this once and I'm sorry for the crappy
  interface. Go to [registration page](https://pyaarlo-tfa.appspot.com/register) and enter
  your email address (or unique ID). The website will reply with a JSON document
  containing your _token_, keep this _token_ and use it in all REST API interactions.
```json
{"email":"testing@testing.com",
 "fwd-to":"pyaarlo@thewardrobe.ca",
 "success":true,
 "token":"4f529ea4dd20ca65e102e743e7f18914bcf8e596b909c02d"}
```

* To add a code send the following HTTP GET request:
```http request
https://custom-host/add?email=test@test.com&token=4f529ea4dd20ca65e102e743e7f18914bcf8e596b909c02d&code=123456
```

You can replace `code` with `msg` and the server will try and parse the code
out value of `msg`, use it for picking apart SMS messages.

##### Using IFTTT

You have your server set up or are using mine, one way to send codes is to use
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to forward SMS messages to the server. I have an
Android phone so use the `New SMS received from phone number` trigger and
match to the Arlo number sending me SMS codes. (I couldn't get the match
message to work, maybe somebody else will have better luck.)

I pair this with `Make a web request` action to forward the SMS code into my
server, I use the following recipe. Modify the email and token as necessary.
```
URL: https://pyaarlo-tfa.appspot.com/add?email=test@test.com&token=4f529ea4dd20ca65e102e743e7f18914bcf8e596b909c02d&msg={{Text}}
Method: GET
Content Type: text/plain
```

Make sure to configure Aarlo to request a token over SMS with `tfa_type='SMS`.
Now, when you login in, Arlo will send an SMS to your phone, the IFTTT app
will forward this to the server and Aarlo will read it from the server.

##### Using EMAIL

If you run your own `postfix` server you can use [this
script](https://github.com/twrecked/pyaarlo-tfa-helper/blob/master/postfix/pyaarlo-fwd.in)
to set up an email forwarding alias. Use an alias like this:
```text
pyaarlo:  "|/home/test/bin/pyaarlo-fwd"
```

Make sure to configure Aarlo to request a token over EMAIL with
`tfa_type='EMAIL`. Then set up your email service to forward Arlo code message
to your email forwarding alias.
